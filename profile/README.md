### Under the Hood: Technical Features
Inferris boasts a large technology stack for many different reasons, which allows us to make what we are building in the first place.

**RESTful API Microservice:**

The REST API serves as the main point of entry for querying and updating player and server data, whether it's a request from a plugin, or from an external app.
- Built with Node.js and Express.js, and uses Redis and MySQL for the data layer.
- Allows custom software, such as an admin panel interface, to GET, POST, and PUT, and integrates with Redis PubSub to properly update the network to make local changes 
- Different endpoints

**Server Architecture:**
Our player data architecture, which uses the Inferris API, ensures seamless synchronization and accessibility across the network, using a carefully architected setup:
- Backend: BungeeCord and Spigot plugins form the foundation of the Minecraft-centered network, enabling smooth transitions between different game modes and servers.
- Caching: Caffeine caching stores frequently accessed data in memory during active sessions for rapid access. Redis provides an additional layer as a persistent in-memory data store, reducing latency and acting as a fallback for session continuity.
- Databases: MySQL offers robust, long-term storage of core player information like ranks, coins, and vanish state. Redis offers fast short-term caching solutions

**Verification System:**
Your identity is unified across the Inferris community via custom integrations:
- Minecraft-Discord Link: Link your Minecraft account to our Discord server, synchronizing in-game ranks and roles.
- XenForo Add-On: The Inferris forums use custom integrations that allow players to verify their accounts, ensuring consistent identification across the community.
