# Inferris

We do cool things here! Currently focused on software development for Minecraft backend servers and proxies. We are working
on our own network infrastructure in Java and Python to create a diverse playable experience. In addition, our hopes are to
use machine learning and AI tools to truly create something awesome.

> Repositories are currently private, but public repos are most definitely planned
