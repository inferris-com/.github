# Inferris

We do cool things here! Inferris at its core is a community game network in production, creating awesome content. Currently focused on software development for Minecraft backend servers and proxies. We are working
on our own network infrastructure in Java and Python to create a spectacular and diverse playable experience, with pure unity and connections in mind. In addition, our hopes are to
use machine learning and AI tools to truly create something unreal. Other plans are to release open source libraries to help out server admins.

> Repositories are currently private, but public repos are most definitely planned
