## Open-Source Initiatives
In addition to our gaming endeavors, we have a keen interest in developing open-source libraries and plugins to assist other server administrators, owners, and developers.

## What will you be able to do @ Inferris?
In the Inferris community, you will find a vibrant and welcoming space where genuine connection, unity, and meaningful conversations take center stage. Here are some of the key activities and experiences you can expect:
1. **Minecraft Server**: The heart of the project is the custom Minecraft server. This server serves as a vibrant hub for a wide range of community activities and games. While it incorporates elements of community input, it primarily serves as a platform where members can come together for meaningful interactions, genuine conversations, and the forging of connections that truly matter.
2. **Monthly Themes**: Inferris regularly transforms into new thematic experiences, offering members fresh adventures. These themes can range from immersive fantasy realms to nostalgic retro vibes or futuristic science fiction odysseys. Each month brings something different, fostering a sense of togetherness and sparking creativity within the community.
3. **Icebreaker Activities**: The community hosts activities like "icebreaker" games to help members get to know each other better in a fun and engaging way. Participants are randomly paired and take turns answering questions to foster conversations and build connections.
4. **Trivia Clash Night**: For some friendly competition and bonding, members can participate in Trivia Clash Night. Teams are formed, and participants answer interesting questions from various categories, ensuring a fun and interactive experience.
5. **Movie Nights**: Join the virtual starry sky for Movie Night Extravaganza! We will be hosting movies together, whether you're a fan of comedy, thrillers, or romantic films. These movie nights are hosted here, allowing you to join the stream and enjoy films with others.
6. **Shared Playlists**: The community likely will share playlists or music recommendations, further enhancing the sense of togetherness through shared interests.

## Is the Minecraft network custom?
Our Minecraft server network is a masterpiece of meticulous customization. We've transcended generic setups by handcrafting our plugins and fine-tuning every detail. This leads to a gaming experience that truly shines, featuring unparalleled features that are designed to foster a sense of unity and connection at its very core.

My commitment to creating an exceptional environment for our community goes beyond the game itself. We're dedicated to providing a space where members can come together, engage in genuine conversations, and build lasting friendships. It's more than just gaming; it's a community in development centered around shared experiences and meaningful connections!

## Project Progress and Development Overview
At Inferris, we've made significant progress in crafting an extraordinary gaming network. Our focus has primarily been on the development of our Minecraft network infrastructure, and we're excited to share our journey with you.

### Minecraft Network Development
Our backend and frontend infrastructures have come a long way, boasting over 170 Java files and classes. This significant milestone represents the foundation of our network, which features a sophisticated multi-layered architecture. This architecture incorporates MySQL for robust relational database management, Redis for lightning-fast in-memory data storage, and local caching mechanisms to optimize data access and retrieval. Together, these layers ensure seamless communication and data handling, setting the stage for the next exciting phase of development: crafting engaging game experiences within our Minecraft server.

While we've made substantial progress in building the infrastructure, the next phase of development will involve crafting engaging game experiences within our Minecraft server and implementing features that not only bring players together but also foster opportunities for meaningful connections to form.

The journey continues, driven by my commitment to unity, positivity, and exceptional experiences. We invite you to be part of the Inferris community, where every moment is a testament to our dedication to creating something truly exceptional. üñ§

### Web Development
I've dedicated time and effort to enhance our web presence, including:
- A vibrant community forum for the future where meaningful discussions and interactions take place.
- Custom web solutions such as in-house Inferris addons for our XenForo forums.
- A dedicated support center to assist our community members.
- Our proprietary email system, powered by Postfix and Dovecot, ensuring seamless communication.
