# Welcome to Inferris! üåü

Inferris is a unique community that seeks to forge meaningful connections through a vibrant Discord server, although we are working on a Minecraft network for any gamers out there. Our goal is to foster unity and nurture individuals so that everyone can thrive, both in fun and deep conversations. We won't be just a platform, but a sanctuary of love, compassion, and understanding‚Äîa haven for everyone to feel validated, understood, and accepted.

### Under the Hood: Technical Features
**Player Data Infrastructure:**
Our player data infrastructure ensures seamless synchronization and accessibility across the network, using a carefully architected stack:
- Backend: BungeeCord and Spigot plugins form the foundation of the network, enabling smooth transitions between different game modes and servers.
- Caching: Caffeine caching stores frequently accessed data in memory during active sessions for rapid access. Redis provides an additional layer as a persistent in-memory data store, reducing latency and acting as a fallback for session continuity.
- Databases: MySQL offers robust, long-term storage of core player information like ranks, coins, and vanish state.

**Verification System:**
Your identity is unified across the Inferris community via custom integrations:
- Minecraft-Discord Link: Link your Minecraft account to our Discord server for a seamless experience, synchronizing in-game ranks and roles.
- XenForo Add-On: The Inferris forums use custom integrations that allow players to verify their accounts, ensuring consistent identification across the community.
