# Inferris

We're all about exciting endeavors here! At its heart, Inferris is a community-driven gaming network in production that's actively producing captivating content. Our current primary focus lies in the realm of software development, specifically geared towards our own network. We're hard at work crafting our own Minecraft network infrastructure, with the aim of delivering an extraordinary and diverse gaming experience that highly prioritizes unity and connection (creating genuine friendships).

Inferris proudly stands as an inclusive community for individuals aged 17+, encompassing not only our meticulously crafted Minecraft server but also our vibrant Discord community server that we really wish make flourish. It's within this digital space that much of our project's essence resides, where meaningful connections are hoped to be forged, and where we encourage deep, real conversations. The real shit, if you know what I mean. Here, we foster unity and create an environment where individuals can thrive in a warm and nurturing atmosphere.

At the heart ♡ of my vision lies a steadfast commitment to cultivating a positive atmosphere—an ecosystem where toxicity absolutely finds no home. I firmly believe in the transformative power of nurturing positivity, tending to it as one would care for a precious garden. Our goal is to ensure that every member of our community can truly experience the essence of togetherness.

Inferris offers a rich tapestry of experiences beyond competition. We will no doubt host a variety of events designed to bring our community closer together, such as movie nights where we gather to watch films, engaging in deep conversations, and organizing fun activities that allow us to share joyous moments as a united group of folks. This endeavor isn't just a project for me; it's an integral part of my lifelong calling. My mission has always been to unite people, and Inferris stands as one of the most special manifestations of that dream. In an age where it can be challenging to find communities that genuinely care, we proudly invite you to Inferris, where unity thrives, positivity blooms, and every moment is a testament to our unwavering commitment to creating something truly exceptional. 🖤

Additionally, we have an interest in creating open-source libraries/plugins to provide assistance to other server administrators, owners, and developers.
